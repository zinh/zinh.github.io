My goal of this year is 2 books per month.

### Factfulness
*Hans Rosling*

Contains lots of useful information, teach me how to recognize exageration on newspaper everyday. 
Let's us have a more optimistic view of the world. 
One thing that I learn and start to notice after reading the book is that newspaper, very much, like the drama and shocking news. 
After all, we are living in a social network era where user's engagement and interaction are the factors. 
If there is nothing controversal, there is not much interest from user if there is no interest from users, there is no advertisment.

### Freedom™(Daemon #2)
*Daniel Suarez*

To be honest, very disappointed and not quite good as part 1. 
The daemon became an omnipotent force so there is not much of a surprise because we know that whatever bad thing happen, the daemon will eventually appear and save the day. 
Also there are lots of side characters and story arc which contribute nothing to the main storyline, such as the Chinese's arc(the one Jon Ross travelled to China) or Phillip's or even the one of Loki.

### The book of tea
*Okakura Kakuzo*

Small book about about the history of teaism(aka 茶道) at Japan, its relation with Zen and Taoism.
It is very well-written by a Japanese scholar over one-hundred years ago and suprisingly was in English.

### The Soul of A New Machine
*Tracy Kidder*

The author has done a great job to describe a hardware project, about what struggle does an engineer have such as fixing bugs or trying to keep the deadline.
I can really relate my day-to-day job to that.

### Spy the Lie: Former CIA Officers Teach You How to Detect Deception
**Philip Houston**

A small book talk about how to know if a person is lying. Although I think we need to take their advice with a grain of salt, I just read another research that stated people usually cannot tell if someone is lying or not and we usually exaggerate about our lying detection ability.

### The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer
**Siddhartha Mukherjee**

This is a book by my favorite author on biology topic. He also wrote another book called The Gene: An Intimate History, both of which is quite long but worth the time. This book covers the history and human's struggle with one of our most fatal disease. Very much recommend it if you are into this kind of topic.

### Programming in Haskell
**Graham Hutton**

The book covers a very basic introduction to functional programming with Haskell. I've been reading it on and off since last year but recently has found time to finish it.
Anyway, comparing with other well-known introductory books about Haskell such as *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!* or *Real World Haskell* *Programming in Haskell* provides a more complete and thorough introduction about the topic. It also contains some exercises for us to practise which I find very useful when learning a programming language.

### Designing Data-intensive application
**Martin Kleppmann**

Although not my first time reading this book(3rd times really), this book still impresses me with the information it contains. If you are into database design or just need to catch up with recent development in database this is your book. It covers a wide range of topic in database system such as indexes, ACID, transaction, NoSQL, OLTP, columnar database, etc. We can see the overall picture of a modern database system, the trade-off it has, some of prominent algorithm, etc. The references section also contains lots of more detailed links/papers/books in case we interest in the topic we can dig in right away.
