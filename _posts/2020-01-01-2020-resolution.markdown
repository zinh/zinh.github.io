2020, start of a new decade and today is January 1st, there is nothing better than getting up early on new year morning and write about my plan.

So last year, I had lots of plan and managed to finish just about 50% of it, hope that I will get a better number this year.

On technical side, I have two big projects for this year: buiding an OS and DB from scratch.

Now to a more detail plan:

## Technical goal

__Courses I want to take__ 

- MIT 6.828: Operating system
- MIT 18.03: Differential equation
- CMU 15-721: Advanced database systems

__Programming languages I want to learn__

- modern CPP
- Scheme
- Advance data structure in Haskell

__Other technology/framework__

- WebAssembly, I still have not decided what to do with WebAssembly, but maybe implement a WebAssembly loader in one of the programming languages that I learnt.
- React implementation(especially fiber and concurrent mode)
- Compiler tooling(LLVM, GNU utilities)

## Books I want to read

- Database Internals: A Deep Dive into How Distributed Data Systems Work
- Streaming Systems
- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
- Brain rules for baby

## Other goal:

- 2 books per month
- N1
- More writing

This is way less heavy than last year but I want to have a feasible plan. 

And let's get started.
