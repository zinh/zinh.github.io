This is the first novel of 2020 that I read and it is a good one.
Sophisticated plot, brilliant world-building and depth character.

The background of this novel is an planet called Stillness.
However, every other years, there is catastrophic happens called the fifth season and each time dragging down its inhabitant and civilization. Our story happens during the tenth season at a land called Sanze.

It told the story of a mother finding her son in this chaos dystopia, little by little her ## is revealed.
