Besides the usual technical-related books, I've tried to read at least 2 books each months.
In restrospect, seems like I couldn't archieved it. Anyway, will try my best next year.

These are the books I've read this year(in no specific order) along with some of my comment.

### Daemon
Suspended book, the computer-related fact is quite accurate.

### Ready player one
I've heard about the movie(but haven't watched it), many people recommend reading the book so I gave it a try.

### Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
I really like this book, the atmosphere about a dystopian future is quite peculiar, although it's quite short.

### The Three-Body Problem
Usually, I am not a fan of modern China's literature

### Essays after eighty

### The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck

### Oryx and Crake
Another book about dystopian future

### Why We Sleep
Explain in detail about how should we sleep

### Leonardo Da Vinci

### To Kill a Mockingbird
Classic book

### The Sympathizer

### Superintelligence\_ Paths, Dangers, Strategies
