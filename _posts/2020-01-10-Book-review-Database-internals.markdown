Database Internals: A Deep Dive into How Distributed Data Systems Work
Alex Petrov

One of the subject that I should have paid more attention in my university's years is database. Working as web engineer, I start to appreciate the important of database
and also the need of understanding its internal.

There is another book that get me back on track and also introduce some modern design of a database system is Designing Data-Intensive Applications. DDIA gives us an overview of the structure of a database. We will have an understanding about ACID, transaction, distributed database, their challenges and how modern database manage to mitigate them.

Database Internals digs deeper into implementation of a modern database system. From organizing index to match with disk access pattern.
