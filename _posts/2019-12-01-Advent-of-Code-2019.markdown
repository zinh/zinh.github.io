Advent of Code is a coding puzzle event that hold from December 1st to 24th. It contains well-crafted coding problems with increasing difficulty when the event go on. It is a very good chances to learn or review a programming language.

I've used Python last time, this year though very much busier than last year, I will try to use C and CPP(whichever is easier to implement).
