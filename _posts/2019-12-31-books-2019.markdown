My goal of this year is 2 books per month.

### Factfulness

Contains lots of useful information, teach me how to recognize exageration on newspaper everyday. Let's us have a more optimistic view of the world. One thing that I learn and start to notice after reading the book is that newspaper, very much, like the drama and shocking news. After all, we are living in a social network era where user's engagement and interaction are the factors. If there is nothing controversal, there is not much interest from user if there is no interest from users, there is no advertisment.

### Freedomâ„¢(Daemon #2)

To be honest, very disappointed and not quite good as part 1. The daemon became an omnipotent force so there is not much of a surprise because we know that whatever bad thing happen, the daemon will eventually appear and save the day. Also there are lots of side characters and story arc which contribute nothing to the main storyline, such as the Chinese's arc(the one Jon Ross travelled to China) or Phillip's or even the one of Loki.

### The book of tea
